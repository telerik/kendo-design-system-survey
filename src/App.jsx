          <p>Whether you're on the development or design end of creating web applications, it's equally easy to lose track of the world beyond your daily work. Sometimes, it can be hard to break out of the silos our companies create for us, inadvertently or on purpose. However, the crossroads of design and development is a bustling, beautiful, and, yes, sometimes a bit of a bumpy place, and it is one worth visiting often for anyone looking to be a better and happier professional.</p>
          <p>We went deep into the findings of the State of Designer-Developer Collaboration 2024 survey and created a report that surfaces everything there is to learn about the relationship between designers and developers, including ideas for making it more efficient and satisfying. To quote Figma's Front End Developer Research Report (Oct 2023), <b>“The designer/developer relationship just might be the most important partnership in business today.”</b></p>

          <h2>Methodology</h2>
        </a>
        <p>The State of Designer-Developer Collaboration 2024 survey was conducted through an online self-completion questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of pre-defined questions exploring the designer-developer collaboration process and design system creation and adoption with their related challenges and benefits.</p>
        <p><b>The target audience for the survey was everyone involved in the design and development of web applications.</b></p>
        <p>Respondents were invited to take the survey through various channels—being prompted on the telerik.com website, through social media and blog post promotion, and through paid promotion in newsletters and on social media.</p> 
        <p>The survey was open for submissions for the period July 18 - September 08, 2024.</p>
        <p>We received a total of 467 responses from 51 countries. Before proceeding with the analysis, we cleaned and validated data for accuracy and relevance using both targeted survey distribution and screening questions to filter out respondents outside our target group and bots. We also learned that bots taking surveys are getting more and more advanced, leaving AI-generated feedback on open-ended questions. After the clean-up, we ended up with 222 respondents.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Web designers or developers</li>

          <p>Anyone who selected a role outside this scope exited the survey. While the responses we got are skewed (82% of respondents were on the engineering side vs. 14% on the design side), the sample is large enough to give us valuable insights. </p>

        <h3>Team Composition</h3>
        <p>The more, the merrier, the saying goes—but is that so when it comes to team composition? The most prevalent team model involves 2-5 developers and 1 designer. This aligns with the ratio that zeroheight saw in their <a href="https://19492330.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/19492330/Community%20and%20Content/How%20We%20Document/HowWeDocument-2024.pdf">Design Systems Report 2023</a>, where they saw ranges between 1:6 and 1:15 depending on company size.</p>
        <p>One in four developers we surveyed doesn't have a designer assigned to their current project. Often, this means that developers are leveraging resources with design “built-in” and making minimal UI changes. This could include <a href="https://www.telerik.com">UI component libraries</a> or pre-existing design systems such as Material or Fluent. For specific design needs, these groups may hire a freelancer or contract worker to help with a one-off design project (read on for more insight on this). Generally, we see this kind of setup in startups, small businesses or other similarly under-resourced ventures. As businesses (and userbases) grow, so does the need for a dedicated designer.</p>
        <p>On the design side, 17% have just one developer they partner with on their current project and 51% work with 2-5 developers.</p>

        <p>When it comes to hiring outside help, most companies seem reluctant — 72% count exclusively on their internal specialists to get the job done.</p>
        <p>A small share of developers (5%), versus none of the designers, report that their companies don't do any design/development work internally.</p>

          <h2>Designer-Developer Collaboration </h2>
        </a>
        <p>Almost half of respondents report having a regular communication rhythm, with 46% of all teams collaborating daily — or at least a few times a week. However, 4% of collaborating designers and developers never communicate directly; rather, they use a mediator. A further 7% collaborate very rarely — just once a month or less! </p>
        <br/>

        <div className='doubleChartFlex'>
          <div className='text'>
            <p>On average, each professional uses 2.3 different communication channels. Happily, 64% of them opt for synchronous one-on-one conversations—either in person or by getting on a call. Team meetings (53%) come in a close second place, followed by messaging and email (51%). Two free-form responses saying they use Azure Dev Ops to communicate piqued our curiosity. That's unique, isn't it? But our favorite response to this question is definitely: “The developers are the designers at our company thru [sic] direction of the IT Manager.” We feel you, folks.

        <h3>The Good and the Bad </h3>
        <p>The good news is that 33% of respondents feel satisfied with their design-to-development process—that's every third person! The bad news is that at least 65% experience challenges (we say at least because many of the free-form responses in the “Other” category also spoke about challenges).</p>
        <p>And now we will find out why making sure that designers and developers collaborate well is business-critical: </p>
        <blockquote>The price many businesses pay for not establishing a smooth design-to-development process is slow time to market. </blockquote>
        
        <br/>

            <h4>What are the main challenges in the design-to-development process in your company? </h4>
            <Challenges/>
          </div>

          <p>Slow time to market is the price 28% of companies pay, but that's not all. 17% of teams suffer from internal conflict—and we all know that conflict at work is often resolved by people leaving the team or company. That, in turn, leads to all sorts of gnarly complications. </p>
          <p>The third most prevalent consequence is low quality of delivery (14%). Some companies may be able to weather this (for a time), but for others, it's a death knell. </p>
 
    
          
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>A "Developers are from Saturn, Designers from Neptune" Kind of Situation </h3>
        <p>Now it's time to open Pandora's Box and look at the split responses of designers and developers. While 36% of engineers say the designer-developer collaboration goes smoothly and without challenges, only 10% of designers would agree.</p> 
        <p>Developers are 50% more likely to experience challenges around slow time-to-market, while designers are more than twice as likely to be concerned about low quality of delivery.</p>
        <p>27% of all respondents report a perfect relationship between design and development on their project (a rating of 9 or 10 on a 10-scale). A further 45% are quite satisfied (a rating of 7 or 8).  </p>
        <p>The “meh” zone is also significant, with 22% going for a 5 or a 6. Sounds innocent enough, but if your partner gave your relationship a 5 or a 6, you'd be on high alert, wouldn't you? </p>
        <p>Just 6% rate their relationship as bad (3 or 4) and no one is in the “complete breakdown” zone. Phew! (And yes, we're all thinking it: those folks do exist, but they are probably way too busy struggling to have time for a survey). </p>
        <br/>
        <h4>If 10 is a perfectly functioning relationship with nothing to add and 1 is a complete breakdown where no one talks to the other, how would you rate the relationship between designers and developers working on the same project? </h4>
        <Relationship/>
       
        <div className='cta'>
          <p>What's the sweet spot between designers and developers? <a href='#download'>Download the report</a> to find out!</p>
        </div>
    
        <p>We also followed up with those who rated their relationship 7 or higher and asked them what they thought worked so well. Sneakily, we gave them the same options as the folks who rated it low. As expected, the results are mirror images. What people in poor relationships crave for is what those in good relationships give credit to for their success. </p>

        <p>What's the cost of inaction, you ask? So did we.</p>
        <p>The top three reported responses about easing the designer-developer relationship all had to do with developers learning more about the goals and processes of their designer counterparts. Whether that's understanding the tools designers are using, the reason why they're making certain design decisions or just becoming an active participant in the design process, it all (clearly) adds up — in this case, to over 50% of issues! </p>

         <p>An insightful free-form response we got: </p>
         <blockquote>“The design tools don't produce things that are usable (…) in the dev tools” </blockquote>

          <h2>Tooling</h2>
        </a>
        <p>Now, for the extra fun part—because who doesn't love to geek out about all the cool tools available for design and dev work these days?</p>

        <div className='chartWrapperLight'>
          <h4>Which design-to-code tools are you currently using?</h4>
          <Tools/>
        </div>

        <p>As expected, we saw some fan favorites in here: Figma and <a href="https://www.telerik.com/themebuilder">Progress ThemeBuilder</a>. But perhaps most surprising was the significant portion (52%) of respondents who aren't using anything at all! Clearly, though, this is still a space that's ripe for innovation and new methods of problem-solving for our modern era of app design and development.</p>

        <h4>How satisfied are you with the output of your design-to-code tool? </h4>
        <div className='pieChartWrapper'>
        <SatisfiedTooling/>
        </div>

        <p>We were also curious what designers were building with their tools, so we asked about the complexity of their prototypes. Most are building highly interactive interfaces—with a smaller percentage sticking to static designs only.</p>

        <h4>How complex are your prototypes? </h4>
         <Complexity/>

         <p>But, of course, the million-dollar question is whether or not they're <i>happy</i> with the finished product. While most are okay with their internal processes, unfortunately only about 1 in 4 are satisfied with the finished work—the rest feel it's not good enough or just “passable.” </p>

         <div className='doubleChartFlex'>
            <div className='chartWrapperLight'>
            <h4>Are you satisfied with the design handoff for your project/product? </h4> 
            <SatisfiedHandoff/>
          </div>
          <div className='chartWrapperLight'>
            <h4>Are you satisfied with the way design is implemented? </h4>
            <SatisfiedDesign/>
          </div>
         </div>

         <p>When we dig into why there's dissatisfaction, it seems to boil down to two main pain points: lack of clarity in the initial doc/file leading to lots of follow-up questions (50%) and changing requirements on the design side (65%). </p>

         <h4>Why not? </h4>
         <WhyNot/>

         <p>Other interesting open-response answers from this section included, “Accessibility issues are often overlooked” and “Designs just don't work in the real world”—both cases where something that looks great “on paper” just doesn't quite align with the practical requirements.</p>
         <p>Speaking of version control, we asked folks about how that looks for them on both the design and dev side of things. </p>

        <div className='chartWrapperDark'>
          <h4>Do you have version control (version history) for your project/product? </h4>
          <VersionControl/>
          <img className='codeIcon' src={lego}/>
        </div>
        <br/>
         <p>As noted earlier, pretty much everyone is using version control for their software...but it's a little more hit-or-miss on the design side, where that's a (relatively) newer concept. At least, assuming we're talking about something a little more standardized than the infamous “design_file_v2_FINAL_FINAL_FINAL_NO_REALLY” naming systems that almost every one of us has been guilty of at some point in our lives.</p>

        <h3>Implementation </h3>
        <p>No matter what tools we're using to get there, the end goal is a beautiful and functional finished application or website. While that's awfully easy to type, it is much harder to accomplish. So, let's look at what goes into getting from concept to production.</p>
        <p>First, who gets to have a say in how the design is implemented? The results show a fairly even split between designers, developers, and product managers—with just a handful including marketing as well.  </p>

        <a className='jumplink' id='designsystems'>
          <h2>Design Systems  </h2>
        </a>
        <p>For our final section, of course we would be remiss if we talked about the designer-developer relationship and didn't ask about design systems. After all, a true design system is a blend of both worlds: a place where design and dev naturally overlap. We don't think there's been either a design or development conference in the last decade where there hasn't been at least one talk about design systems. Let's dig in:  </p>

        <div className='doubleChartFlex'>
          <div>
            <h4>First, the obvious: do you have a design system? </h4>
            <DesignSystem/>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>How long have you had a design system in place? </h4>
            <DesignSystemAge/>
          </div>
        </div>

      <p>About half of all respondents did—whether it was one they had just started or a more mature and established system. Of those who didn't, about one-third were planning to create one in the future. </p>

      <div className='chartWrapperDark'>
        <h4>What is your approach when creating a design system? </h4>
        <DesignSystemApproach/>

      </div>
      
      <p>Of the folks that had or were planning to create a design system, most were working from the basis of a larger, established design system (like Material Design or Fluent). This makes a ton of sense — after all, why reinvent the wheel?</p>
      <p>Naturally, we were also curious about each respondent's role in shaping and using their design systems.  </p>

      <div className='doubleChartFlex'>
        <div className='chartWrapperLight'>
          <h4>What was your role in creating the design system you have in place currently? </h4>
          <DesignSystemRole/>
        </div>
        <div className='chartWrapperLight'>
          <h4>How often do you use the design system you have in place currently? </h4>
          <DesignSystemUse/>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div className='chartWrapperDark'>
        <h4>Who decided that you'll be creating an internal design system? </h4>
          <DesignSystemCreation/>
      </div>
      <p>Most folks who made it this far in the survey were either direct contributors or consultants in some way to the creation of the system (whether that was in the past or actively ongoing), with 23% not involved at all. Similarly, most of the respondents with established design systems used them regularly in their day-to-day work, with only 6% not using them. However, when it came to who got the final say on design system creation, it was overwhelmingly the design leads — with almost half of respondents saying that the Design Lead or Design System Lead was the one who decided to create the system.  </p>

      <h4>Do you think your company or business unit would benefit from adopting a design system? </h4>
        <DesignSystemBenefit/>

      <br/>
      <p>For those without a design system, the vast majority (about 80%) felt like it would either somewhat or definitely benefit them to adopt one. However, we all know that's easier said than done... </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Design System Challenges & Benefits </h3>
        <p>This next set of questions sheds some light on the primary inhibitors to design system creation. While resource dedication (time, energy, finances, etc.) all play a role, lack of buy-in at the management level was reported as the primary factor standing in the way.  </p>
        <br/>
        <div className='doubleChartFlex'>
          <div>
            <h4>Why don't you have a design system in place if you think your company would benefit from it?</h4>
            <DesignSystemBlockers/>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Which of these factors impacted the adoption and usage of design system the most in your company? </h4>
            <DesignSystemAdoption/>
          </div>
        </div>
        <br/>
        <p>Of course, once you've cleared the hurdle of creating the design system, that doesn't mean it's all sunshine and roses. There are different pain points when we're talking about adopting a design system. For our respondents, the biggest struggles were getting design and dev aligned and establishing clear processes — things that naturally go together. After that, documenting everything and proving ROI were the next biggest challenges.  </p>

        <div className='doubleChartFlex'>
          <div className='chartWrapperDark'>
            <h4>What are the main challenges of creating a design system? Select all that apply.</h4>
            <DesignSystemCreationChallenge/>
          </div>
          <div className='chartWrapperDark'>
            <h4>What are the main challenges of maintaining a design system? Select all that apply.</h4>
            <DesignSystemMaintenanceChallenge/>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Now, it's not all bad—after all, if it was, nobody would bother. A design system requires significant upfront time and energy (and no small amount of maintenance afterwards), but it pays back those investments in spades.  </p>

        <div className='doubleChartFlex'>
          <div className='chartWrapperLight'>
            <h4>What are your top 3 goals in creating a design system?</h4>
            <DesignSystemGoals/>
          </div>

          <div className='chartWrapperLight'>
            <h4>What are the top 3 benefits of having a design system in place?</h4>
            <DesignSystemImplemented/>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>Even better, the results show that expectations are matched by results in many cases. For the folks that don't yet have a finished design system — better user experience, improved consistency and faster design to dev time are the top 3 reasons why they want one. And great news: those are also the top 3 benefits listed by folks who do have them! It's reassuring to see that expectations and results are aligned regarding the power and impact of a design system.  </p>

        <h4>What is the general feeling in your team regarding the adoption/usage of design systems?</h4>
        <div className='pieChartWrapper'>
        <DesignSystemFeelings/>
        </div>

        <p>Overall, about half of users felt that design systems solved their problems, and the other half felt that it solved some problems but also created some new ones. Only 3% of users felt that it was a net negative, creating too many issues to be worthwhile. It's always reassuring to see that such a huge project isn't just wishful thinking; it does have real, tangible benefits.  </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Design System Tools and Maintenace</h3>
        <p>When it comes to maintenance and continued contributions to the design system, our survey found that there are two main approaches: everyone contributes equally or a dedicated design system team owns the system.  </p>

        <div className='chartWrapperDark'>
          <h4>Who's responsible for maintaining and/or contributing to the design system in your company? Select all that apply.</h4>
          <DesignSystemContributor/>
        </div>
        <br/>
        <p>When it comes to tooling, we see some familiar old favorites made an appearance again: Figma and Visual Studio/VS Code. Axure was a common write-in — we'll make sure to include it next year — but otherwise, no real surprises here. </p>
        <br/>
        <div className='doubleChartFlex'>
          <div>
            <h4>Which tools will you use for the creation of your design system? Select all that apply.</h4>
            <DesignSystemCreationTools/>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Which tools do you use for the maintenance of your design system? Select all that apply.</h4>
            <DesignSystemMaintenanceTools/>
          </div>
        </div>
        <br/>
        <p>The other good news is that folks are, on balance, happy with those tools. While just over 40% feel that there’s room for improvement, only 12% are outright unhappy with their options. </p>

        <div className='chartWrapperLight'>
          <h4>Do you believe your team/company is using the tools that best enable designer-developer collaboration?</h4>
          <div className='pieChartWrapper'>

        <h3>The Future of Design Systems </h3>
        <p>What's a survey without a good predictions section? Let's see what folks are planning, excited for and thinking about with their design systems in the years ahead.</p>

        <h4>Are you experimenting with AI in your design system</h4>
        <div className='pieChartWrapper'>
        <DesignSystemAI/>
        </div>

        <p>When it comes to AI in design systems, most folks are still feeling hesitant. Only 7% have implemented AI in their design system currently, and (from our open response follow-up question) they're primarily using GenAI to answer questions or create placeholder elements. 37% consider using AI to make suggestions, create templates or help brainstorm ideas.  </p>

        <h4>In a best-case scenario, what do you want for your company's design system in the future?</h4>
        <DesignSystemFuture/>
        <br/>
        <p>Long term, most respondents are hopeful that their design system becomes an integral aspect of their internal design-to-development process, serving as a single source of truth that's continually updated and well-maintained. Only 6% are hoping to follow in the footsteps of giants and launch their design system for public use. To them, we wish the very best of luck and look forward to seeing what they create!  </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          </a>
          <p>When we look at these results compiled together, it's easy to feel optimistic about the future of designer/developer collaboration. Sure, there's work to be done—no doubt about it. But it's reassuring to see that none of the problems are insurmountable or unsolvable.</p>  
          <p>Many of the challenges hinge on communication: not speaking the same language, getting involved in the process too late, not checking in often enough, not clearly communicating expectations, not sharing a tool set. These aren't problems that will magically solve themselves. They require a commitment from both parties to work together towards bridging the gap. But as they say: “We have the technology. We have the capability...” </p>
